# SQL-Business-Analytics
 
In this exercise we will be answering some hypothetical questions about a hypothetical online music store (similar to iTunes) called Chinook. We will be answering questions related to Chinook's business, employee performance, etc. We will also perform a bit of data segmentation.

A couple of questions weâ€™ll answer:
- Which music genre performs best in the USA?
- Which employees have the best sales performance?
- Should management purchase individual tracks or entire albums from record labels to maximize profit?
