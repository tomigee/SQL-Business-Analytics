    "### 2.4 - Categorizing each invoice as an album purchase or not\n",
    "Chinook management team is evaluating a purchase strategy proposal that would allow them to purchase specific tracks from labels, as opposed to entire albums. This looks attractive to management because they would save money if they didn't have to purchase entire albums, but purchased only the popular songs instead. To examine this proposal, they've asked to analyze how customers currently purchase music from the store--do they purchase more often by album, or by individual tracks?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can categorize each invoice into two buckets:\n",
    "* Whole albums purchases\n",
    "* Individual track purchases\n",
    "\n",
    "We know, for the purposes of this analysis, that invoices with a whole album purchased ***do not*** also include individual tracks. In other words, an invoice is either entirely a whole album, or entirely a collection of tracks from different albums. We can use this information to aid our analysis by creating a view that comprises of one (effectively random) track from each invoice. We can then find the other `track_id`s in the album that this track belongs to, and cross reference that list with the other `track_id`s in the invoice."

    "Looks like of all the invoices, only 18% of them are full album purchases, indicating that most customers of the Chinook music store pick and choose the individual tracks they like, when shopping. This indicates that the Chinook management team might be better served purchasing only the popular songs from the record companies. As a next step, it would be worth exploring just how this strategy would affect Chinook's customers. In other words, if Chinook management only bought the most popular songs for, say, the past two years, how much revenue would they have missed out on in terms of song purchases? Then we can compare this number to the amount of money they'd have saved by not purchasing the full albums. If the latter number is greater than the former, then the management team should only buy popular songs, instead of entire albums."
